# Tic-Tac-Toe (Java Swing)

This project is a **Java Swing implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game**. 
It features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Swing where two players (X and O) take turns playing until someone wins or the game ends in a tie.

## ✨ Features
- 3x3 Tic-Tac-Toe grid using JButtons
- Two-player mode (Player X vs Player O)
- Real-time turn updates in top panel
- Automatic win detection:
    - Horinzontal
    - Vertical
    - Diagonal & Anti-Diagonal
- Tie detection

##  🛠️ Technologies
- **Java 21+**
- **Java Swing** (`JFrame`, `JPanel`, `JButton`, `JLabel`, `GridLayout`, `BorderLayout`)
- Event handling with **ActionListener**

  A fun project to practice **Java Swing GUI development** and **event-driven programming**.

  ## Credits
  This project was created with the help of Kenny Yip Coding on YouTube.
  I followed along and modified parts of the implementation to better understand **Java Swing** and **event-driven programming**.
